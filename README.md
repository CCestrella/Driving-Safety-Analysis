# Driving-Safety-Analysis
This project analyzes traffic fatalities across different states in the U.S., using data from various sources such as the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and state-level driving safety reports. The analysis focuses on trends in fatalities, miles driven, and fatality rates per million vehicle miles traveled.
